CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:26 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findcustom_roi_srv.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "custom_roi_srv", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "custom_roi_srv"
  with any of the following names:

    custom_roi_srvConfig.cmake
    custom_roi_srv-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "custom_roi_srv" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "custom_roi_srv_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "custom_roi_srv" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
